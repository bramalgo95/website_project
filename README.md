# website_project
Hello everyone.

This is my website project created during my learning journey with The Odin Project. 
I worked here using the flexbox model.
This feature enabled me to create layouts more efficiently and comprehensively.

As directed by The Odin Project, I made an effort to adhere to the desired layout.
The website's design, in my opinion, is quite attractive and nice.

The website's content was exclusively written by me for this project.
Images used in this project are from the following website: https://www.pexels.com/

My idea was to create a nice travel agency website, which has the potential to evolve into a real-world project.
It just needs to be developed more precisely in the future since the links aren't leading us to the right pages.
